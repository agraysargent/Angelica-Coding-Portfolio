# Portfolio
This assignment that was given to us required us to create a portfolio displaying an About Me/Experience/Contact section, with links navigating to each section. In addition to displaying and properly linking homeworks with functioning image links. The goal of the assignment was to ensure that we created a portfolio that reflected the coder as an individual, their past works/experience, some information about them, and points of contact.

# User Story
AS AN employer. I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples. SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
